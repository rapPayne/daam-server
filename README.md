# API data server

A RESTful server to serve data for the DAAM restaurant app.

To start it up:
```bash
npm install
npm run load-db
npm start
```
## To get data from it
Make GET requests using Postman or [Hoppscotch](http://hoppscotch.io). But you'll need to authenticate to get to certain orders and other things.

## To authenticate
Make a POST request to /login with {"username": ____, "password": "pass" }. (All passwords are pass until you decide to change them.)
- Servers are "server1", "server2", and "server3"
- Admin users are "admin", and "cmac"
- Regular users are "me", and all the other regular users whose usernames and passwords you can look up in the database.

## Database collections
See [database.json](database.json) for the final structure. Here's a general layout.
